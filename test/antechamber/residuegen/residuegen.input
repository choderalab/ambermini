#SEP_BOND:      	Bonds that separate residue and caps, input in a format of (Atom_Name1 Atom_Name2 TYPE),

#PSEUDO_HEAD_ATOM:     	Psedu_head_atom is used by the program to determine the main chain atoms for C-terminal

#                       molecules. 
#                       This option is suppressed by a SEP_BOND with TYPE of 1.

#PSEUDO_TAIL_ATOM:     	Psedu_tail_atom is used by the program to determine the main chain atoms for N-terminal

#                       Input in a format of (Atom_Name), may show up only once not show up at all for organic

#			Main chain atoms are those starting from HEAD_ATOM or PSEUDO_HEAD_ATOM and ending at 
#			TAIL_ATOM or PSEUDO_TAIL_ATOM for the amino-acid-like or nucleic-acid-like residues.
#			For organic molecules, main chain atoms are those forming the longest chain. Main 
#			chain atoms are identified automatically (not need to specify). 

#NET_CHARGE:    	Net charge of the residue, such as 0 of ALA and -1 of ASP and 1 of LYS
